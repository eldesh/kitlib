['a uref] type of uref-elements with contents of type 'a.

[uref x] creates a new element with contents x.

[equal (e, e')] returns true if and only if e and e' are either made
by the same call to uref or if they have been unioned (see below).

[!!e] returns the contents of e. Note: if 'a is an equality type
then !!(uref x) = x, and equal(uref (!!x), x) = false.

[e ::= x] updates the contents of e to be x.

[unify f (e, e')] makes e and e' equal; if v and v' are the contents
of e and e', respectively, before unioning them, then the contents
of the unioned element is f(v,v').

[Discussion]

The Uref module is in principle a Union/Find data type with a ref-like
interface.  A Union/Find structure consists of a type constructor 'a
uref with operations for making an element of 'a uref (uref), getting
the contents of an element (!!), checking for equality of two elements
(equal), and for joining two elements (unify).  The type 'a uref is
analogous to 'a ref as expressed in the following table:

     ------------------------------------------------------
     type                  'a ref                'a uref
     ------------------------------------------------------
     introduction          ref                   uref
     elimination           !                     !!
     equality              =                     equal
     updating              :=                    ::=
     unioning                                    unify
     ------------------------------------------------------

The main difference between 'a ref and 'a uref is in the union
operation.  Without union, 'a ref and 'a uref can be used
interchangebly.  An assignment to a reference changes only the
contents of the reference, but not the reference itself.  In
particular, any two pointers that were different (in the sense of the
equality predicate = returning false) before an assignment will still
be so.  Their contents may or may not be equal after the assignment,
though.  In contrast, applying the union operation (unify) to two uref
elements makes the two elements themselves equal (in the sense of the
predicate equal returning true).  As a consequence their contents will
also be identical. The contents is determined by a binary function
parameter.
